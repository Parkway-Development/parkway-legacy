# Contributions and Donations
### A *contribution* is considered a cash gift to the church that:
- **ARE** recorded in the transaction ledger
- **ARE** included in a batch deposit
- **DO** directly impacts monetary balances in any account
- **ARE** eligible for tax credits
- Tithes and Offerings are typical examples of a contribution

### A *donation* is to be considered a non-cash gift of either products and/or services to the church.  They come in a few flavors.
- **Standard**
    - Someone gives the church something and does not want tax credit for it.
    - Not recorded as part of our system
  -  
- **Tax Credit Option 1**
  - The donor **DOES NOT** have a receipt to prove the value of the item.
  - In this instance, the item **DOES NOT** hit any sort of financial record.
  - The church provides a letter of receipt with an empty spot for the donor to insert their perceived value of the donated item(s).  
    - If in the future we have a record of this type of donation, the letter is the output of that process.
- **Tax Credit Option 2**
  - The donor **DOES** have a receipt to prove the value of the item.
  - This **DOES** hit the ledger as a credit, with the donation attached to the donors profile.
    - The value of the credit is the cost listed on the receipt.
    - We may have to deal with the taxes differently than just lumping them in with the total amount.  Not sure.
  - This also gets recorded as a debit in the ledger to offset the monetary value of the credit from the donation.  The sum of the debits must equal the credit.

**Example**

Jill goes to Kroger and purchases 5 $25 gift cards.  She donates those to the church for the church to hand out to those in need of groceries.

- When the church receives them, along with the receipt, 
  - A $125 credit is applied to the ledger
  - That credit is recorded as a donation on Jill's profile.
- The church gives out 2 of the $25 gift cards
  - A $50 debit is recorded against the donation, reducing the remaining value of the donation to $75. 
- The church gives out the 3 remaining gift cards
  - A $75 debit is recorded against the donation, reducing the remaining value of the donation to $0.  That donation cannot be used again.
