## Subsplash Transfer
### Notes
1. Each transaction is equivalent to a credit card transaction.
2. In each transaction there are fees associated with the processing of the transaction.
3. People can pay for their fees as part of the transaction.  For example, a $100 tithe where the person covers a 3% fee will show a transaction of $103, but the transfer to the bank will be for $100.
4. People may include notes for special processing info to church staff.
5. The contribution is created assigned to a "fund" or account.
6. Sometimes the account assignment is not correct and must be adjusted by church staff.
7. Sometimes notes are included to adjust how the donation is to be split between accounts manually by church staff.
8. The process is not 100% accurate from Subsplash.  Sometimes the report will show a transaction as being transferred when it has not been transferred. 

### Process
1. Multiple credit card transactions occur in a week.
2. At processing time, those transactions are gathered into a batch and transferred to the bank.
3. Church staff download an excel report of the contents of the batch
4. Church staff upload the batch report
5. Each transaction is extracted from the report and created.
6. For each transaction, the account assignment is created.
7. All transactions are gathered into a deposit batch for approval and processing
8. Church staff review the batch and make changes as needed based on the notes or other information they may have.
9. Once the batch is approved, all transactions are committed and all debits and credits are created.
10. Once deposited (approved and processed)  A batch cannot be deleted and the only thing that can be modified is a) the profile it belongs to or b) the division and assignment to accounts.
